Dying Light is one of my favorite titles from this console generation.  The
strength of its gameplay loop lied in the marriage of its visceral melee combat
and frenetic parkour, all placed neatly in a sandbox for your judo mayhem. So
to my surpise, a DLC "expansion" came out this week, well over five years after
release, themed around Techland's shelved dungeon crawler Hellraid . However,
is this new content any good? Sadly not. 

The gimmick here is that you've been teleported inside of an arcade machine
possessed by demons, and you have to fight your way through various combat
arenas to collect the three magical macguffins, all neatly framed inside of a
roguelite game mode, where you have three attempts to clear the dungeon or lose
everything. 

At first, fighting your way through hordes of reskinned zombies is fun. From
the allmighty dropkick to Crane's bulldozer charge, comboing together his
offensive parkour moves for crowd control and finishers is incredibly
satisfying to pull off.  But then the problems arise.

First things off, Hellraid is way too dark. And for some reason, when the game
takes away your equipment, it also removes your flashlight, so you can't see
shit unless you crank up the gamma, which ruins the atmosphere. After that, you
quickly realize this "expansion" is entirely focused on combat, with little in
the way of exploration or platforming.

Now, if the encounters were well designed and paced appropriately, then I could
see this working, but what we got was anything but. All of these fights occur
in square open arenas, generally with multiple floors of elevation and few
natural chokepoints. Because there are so few background objects, you can't
reliably use the environment for parkour like in the base game. Adding onto
this, every...single...encounter has waves of runners and skeletal knights
clown carring in from every nook and cranny. 

On hard mode, trying to slay them in the open is borderline suicide. Skeletal
knights love to parry your melee swings and they tank blows like raid bosses
due in part to the garbage weapon drops. Now, I get that this encourages you to
use your mobility to open up foes to executions, but there are several problems
with this approach. First, it's not consistent as to what moves do and do not
disable enemies. My ram charge seemed to make them flinch for a bit, while the
legbreaker sometimes knocked them over. Secondly, the finisher prompt only
seems to appear about a third of the time, so I often kicked zombies instead of
executing them. This might be an issue with how hitboxes are handled in
Hellraid, since this problem is rare otherwise.  Finally, you have lengthy
setup and recovery animations for executions. And because the arenas in
Hellraid are so cramped, expect to lose a quarter of your life whenever you
perform a takedown, since you will get hit. 

Eventually, the spam got so annoying that I resorted to exploiting Dying
Light's combat system to make things more tolerable. Excluding runners,
skeletons and zombies cannot climb objects nor hit you while you're on them.
So, I always took the chance to find and perch upon a modestely sized piece of
cover, and whack at the skeletons until they fell apart. Repeat for about
thirty minutes, ocassionally adding in some situational runner killing. 

This all ends when the game introduces its bullshit zombie mages. Individually,
they're not that awful, as the fireballs are slow enough to dodge. However, you
only fight a single caster once, as the game decides to spam them alongside
skeletons, torturer minibosses, and runners for the rest of the experience. So
now, not only do you need to deal with the frustrating fodder spam, you need to
deal with constant spell barrages.  And even if you get into melee range with
casters, they can still hadouken blast you in the face, taking out a quarter of
your life. Oh, and for the cherry on top, they move erratically, so it's hard
to reliably hit them.

Ultimately, I gave up on hard mode when the game decided to respawn me at the
first room of the dungeon after I died, but not reset the script triggers or
keep the pathways open. As a result, I couldn't retread my steps or progress at
all and I was completely stuck. Now, if Hellraid mixed up enemy spawns and had
any  procedural level or tile arrangement to keep things fresh, I wouldn't mind
giving it a go another. But between the fixed level progression and complete
inability to save, exit, and resume your run at a later time, I had little
desire to play on hard again. 

So I decided to start on normal difficulty, which changes the entire
experience. Instead of a frustrating cheesefest, the game becomes a
mindnumbingly dull cakewalk, as you can button mash your way to victory.
Enemies get stunlocked easier and take far less blows to kill, so you don't
need to use executions to dispatch foes. Furthermore, their attacks deal far
less damage, so it's trivial to shrug them off, especially when the game
liberally throws healing potions at you.  And paradoxically, you get better
rarity weapons on this difficulty than on hard, as I only got one or two rares
on each of those runs, whereas I was drowning in purples on normal. 

Really, the only parts of normal where things got remotely difficult is at the
end of Hellraid, where Techland completely gives up on any semblance of
encounter design. Here, you're fighting in a small circular arenas with no
cover outside of some small banisters and seemingly unclimable bandstands.
Dozens upon dozens of runners, skeletal knights, and torturers swarm in on your
location.  And on top of that, there are always about half a dozen spellcasters
spamming fireballs at you. At some point, you're going to get overwhelmed by
the sheer volume and get pummeled to death, because you literally cannot escape
the dogpile once caught. I've played bullet hell shooters less insane than
this.

And to top it all off, the "epic showdown" with the minotaur is just a fight
with a reskinned demolisher from the base game. Bait his highly telegraphed
charges, whack at him a few times, rinse and repeat.  Congratulations, you just
beat Hellraid. 

So, what are your rewards for clearing ba'al's "legendary" dungeon? A common
weapon, 2 health potions, and a couple hundred Hellraid funbucks to help you
grind more. 

Techland, this is fucking pathetic. I know you can do better than this.  A
beginning modder can do better. Hell, I've done better than this. I really
don't know what's more insulting, the fact that they're charging money for this
crap, or that it exists alongside the excellent base game and the following
expansion.

The only silver lining to this DLC is that Techland has promised free content
updates to Hellraid. And given that they've been regularly patching the game
for over 5 and a half years now, I'm inclined to believe them. But if there's
any chance of salvaging this DLC, the developers need to go back to the drawing
board and fundamentally rethink this DLC's design, because there's barely
anything worth salvaging here right now. 

Thank you all very much for watching. I'd like to give special thanks to XX and
YY for taking a look at my script and giving feedback on it. As for the
schedule of content, I've hit a bit of writer's block with the DOOM Eternal
script, so it was on hold for a bit. Ditto with Borderlands 3, though I did
make some good progress on that one. I've also got a special project in the
works for Age of Empires 3, though I'll officially announce it when it's
looking more complete. If you'd like to stay up to date on channel news, you

Finally, if you'd like to help out the channel financially in these tough
times, consider subscribing to my Patreon page over at Patreon.com/SquidTheSid

As always,

Stay Frosty.
